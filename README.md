## ✨ About the Project
I’m a fresh IT graduate and self-taught developer passionate about turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly web experiences. My focus is on building clean, component-driven interfaces that are both functional and visually engaging.

Currently, I’m sharpening my expertise in React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit, and TanStack Query, while also exploring backend technologies to grow into a more complete developer.

This portfolio was crafted not just to showcase my projects, but also to reflect my design philosophy: clean, minimalist, and intuitive interfaces backed by solid code. It serves as both a personal brand hub and a project showcase, giving employers and collaborators a clear picture of what I can create.
